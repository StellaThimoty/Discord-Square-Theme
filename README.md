# Discord-Square-Theme
I made this because the new discord update looks absolutely hideous and I needed to upload that picture somewhere in good quality

I don't own the other themes stored here, they're here literally to make it easier to find when making dotfiles. If anything, I'll just check out the source and pick out what I like and filter out what I don' like from them, which I think is the better solution
