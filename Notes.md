This is a personal project and I curse a lot, so don't expect decorum here

I don't think this info is important enough to be on the README but I digress, I have to talk about the stuff I'm doing here to have some proper documentation

Honestly I have altered so much from base discord themes that I were uising I don't know if I even need a proper theme anymore,
the only reason I looked into basicbg and translunce was so I could find a way to put a bg without much hassle,
in the end, I ended up doing majority of things myself because I disagreed with their direction

The way I'm doing things is a mess, in short, I notice something annoying and then fiddle around until it looks decent
discord html doesn't make any sense though, the classes are okay and they probably have their reasons
I have no idea why sometimes their html has inline styles and sometimes doesn't, just wtf man

I wish I was better at react so I could actually debug the trainwreck that is this thing, anyhow, this has actually taught me something about css selectors
